# Winning the Space Race with Data Science

## IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

In the rapidly evolving commercial space industry, Space Y aims to gain competitive insights into SpaceX's launch operations through comprehensive data analysis. This project leverages advanced data science techniques to understand and predict critical aspects of rocket launches.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data science workflows, models, and insights for Space Y's competitive analysis initiative. By analysing historical launch data, we aim to develop predictive models that can inform strategic decision-making for future Space Y missions.

## Key Objectives

- **Predict first stage rocket landing probability** using machine learning algorithms
- **Understand factors influencing launch success** through statistical analysis
- **Provide actionable insights** for Space Y's launch strategy and operational planning
